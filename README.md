A dump of sample data used to perform the FOCUSED Sponsorship Analysis

## What Is This Repo About
Free and Open-Source Software depends heavily on the community participation. One way companies participate in the community is by sponsoring foundations, events, and open source projects. But we don't have a good historical overview of how spending and funding has evolved over time. 

My goal is to collect public sponsorship data for events, foundations, programs, and projects within the free and open source software ecosystem.

Having all of this information together in one place can serve several purposes:
 * Inspiration for people who are trying to put together a prospectus for their own efforts;
 * Reference material for funding research initiatives;
 * Transparency;

## Contributing To This Repository

Today, this repo contains only samly data that has been dumped from google sheets. That's the wrong way to do this, but it's a good place to start.

If you want to get involved in contributing to this project, please begin by opening an issue and introducing yourself. 

If you're looking to get involved right away, we are collecting Prospectuses in the [FOSS-Prospectus-Archive](https://github.com/JumpsuitWizard/FOSS-Prospectus-Archive) and we would love your help.
